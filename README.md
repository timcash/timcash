# Welcome
Hello, I'm Tim. Software and Mathematics are a life long process of learning for me. They are languages, and something different. Not only like verbal or wittern langauge and not only like a musical or sign language. If used as the fundemental units to build on they can describe with precision not only thier meaning but also a program that can unfold over time. Sharing these programs is a new way to work together. Below is a small collection of my work, and work that builds on others. My partner and I are looking for students. We teach in via discord or keet.io in the evenings GMT-5

# Chromatic Systems

## Project Background
Samples of integrating popular open source libs to get students up to speed quickly on contributing to real systems.
https://chromatic.systems

My wife and I are building a school to teach p2p technologies and mathematics. We have over 20 modules now designed as interactive apps with popular open source libraries integrated as a starting point. The system has a built-in editor that makes it easy to code up new pages and deploy them to a global content delivery network without anything but the Web. The front end is all minimal javascript and some web-components without any framework. The backend is redis graph and soon a bit of hypercore-protocol. Our goal is step by step mathematical, computer science, and physics content that is easy to edit and get feedback. We recently started integrating code completion via `codex`.

## We focus on creating
1. Art
2. Music
3. Games

## So we can build a lasting curiosity about
1. Math
2. Science
3. Systems

## Upgrading education systems
Live feedback, ambient learning, exploration supported by a group of mentors and peers. The purpose of this system is to spark creativity and spontaneous re-categorification of knowledge.
- no tests
- no grades
- no homework


## Why learning 1 on 1 and pair programming
Building together can greatly accelerate learning. A small amount of time a few days a week practicing a skill. We work with real systems and code to develop a style that fits your needs. After the inital setup of the workspace there are no taxonomies or hierarchies, no checklists or rubrics. Maybe it will be sound, poetry, or a game. Maybe it will be a new way to think about the world.

## Music & Math

## Exploration with a new compass

## Numbers come in many forms
![Earthy Fractals](images/composite.png)
> A study of complex numbers, fractals and coloring algorithms. Written from scratch in javascript. The coloring algorithm was challenging and fun. Three hours of wirting this program taught me more than three months of college algebra.

## Computation
They are languages of a different category. A real beauty of language is when we start to combine them, to blend them and compose them. In math we have very precise words to describe many ways of doing this. For Example the following symbols tell us a deep story about how building systems of symbols in just the right way can lead to a very powerful and useful tool.

# A tour of symbols
## Algebras Groups & Rings
1. A * B = B * A
1. A * (B * C) = (A * B) * C
1. A * A^-1 = I
1. A * I = A
1. A * 0 = 0
1. A + 0 = A
1. A + -A = 0
> a machine learning algorim filled in 4 of the above statements, by using the underlying mechamism of these statesments. That is increadible.

## 1e9 & Estimation
A single page guide to large numbers and estimation
1. 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
1. 100 100 100 100 10
1. 1e2 1e2 1e2 1e2 1e1
1. 1e4 1e4 1e1
1. 1e9
1. 1e0 x 1e9 = 1e9
1. 1e1 x 1e9 people on earth
1. 1e2 x 1e9 
1. 1e3 x 1e9 dollars in a national budget
1. 1e4 X 1e9 cells in the human body
1. 1e5 x 1e9 microbes in the human body

## Morphisms connecting the dots
1. Focus on the relationship between the parts
1. All sets become a point called S
1. All algebras become a point called A
1. All categories become a point called C
1. All geometries become a point called G
1. What can we say about S -> A -> C -> G -> S
1. ACG can become a point called X
1. S -> (ACG) -> S becomes S -> X -> S
