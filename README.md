# Welcome
Hello, I'm Tim.

Software and Mathematics are a life long process of learning for me. This site has a small collection of my work, and work that builds on open source. To sign up for my course see (https://timcash.io)

# 1:1 Math & Software Tutoring
See https://timcash.io for more information

## Learning 1 on 1 and pair programming
Building together can greatly accelerate learning. A small amount of time a few days a week practicing a skill. Live feedback, ambient learning, and exploration supported by mentors are keys to immersive education.

# Development Style
1. Keep it simple - did you ship something?
1. Pair Programming & Team Programming
1. Test Driven Design
1. Continuous Integration and Delivery
1. Testing in Production
