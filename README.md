# Other projects

https://chromatic.systems

My wife and I are building a school to teach p2p technologies and mathematics. We have over 20 modules now designed as interactive apps with popular open source libraries integrated as a starting point. The system has a built-in editor that makes it easy to code up new pages and deploy them to a global content delivery network without anything but the Web. The front end is all minimal javascript and some web-components without any framework. The backend is redis graph and soon a bit of hypercore-protocol. Our goal is step by step mathematical, computer science, and physics content that is easy to edit all through code on the site.

# Maths Mentoring

I teach private maths lessons using github and code as the foundation.
