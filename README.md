# Welcome
Hello, I'm Tim. Software and Mathematics are a life long process of learning for me. They are languages, and something different. Not only like verbal or written language and not only like a musical or sign language. If used as the fundamental units to build on they can describe with precision not only their meaning but also a program that can unfold over time. Sharing these programs is a new way to work together. This site has a small collection of my work, and work that builds on others (OSS). My partner and I are looking for other learners to join us. We teach via discord or keet.io in the evenings GMT-5

# Chromatic Systems
## A School for Geospatial Systems Software and Mathematics on Encrypted Peer-to-Peer Networks
![A globe partitioned into hexagons](./images/logo_ml_duo.png)
> ML variation (left) Our algorithm (right)

## Project Background
Samples of integrating popular open source libs to get students up to speed quickly on contributing to real systems.
https://chromatic.systems

## Upgrading education systems
Live feedback, ambient learning, exploration supported by a group of mentors and peers. The purpose of this system is to spark creativity and spontaneous re-categorification of knowledge.
- no tests
- no grades
- no homework

## Why learning 1 on 1 and pair programming
Building together can greatly accelerate learning. A small amount of time a few days a week practicing a skill. We work with real systems and code to develop a style that fits your needs. After the inital setup of the workspace there are no taxonomies or hierarchies, no checklists or rubrics. Maybe it will be sound, poetry, or a game. Maybe it will be a new way to think about the world.

## Exploration with a new compass

> Global soil sample data streamed into sqllite and transformed into geoJSON

## Numbers come in many forms
![Earthy Fractals](images/composite.png)
> A study of complex numbers, fractals and coloring algorithms. Written from scratch in javascript. The coloring algorithm was challenging and fun. Three hours of code into this program taught me more than three months of college algebra.
