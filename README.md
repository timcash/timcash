# Welcome
Hello, I'm Tim. Software and Mathematics are a life long process of learning for me. This site has a small collection of my work, and work that builds on others (OSS). My partner and I are looking for other learners to join us. We teach via discord or keet.io in the evenings GMT-5. 

## Overview
1. Some Professional Highlights
1. OSS Libraries and Studies
1. Chromatic Systems our school for geospatial data and mathematics

# Technologies Deployed to Production
* Web - Javascript, Nodejs, React, web-componets
* Cloudflare - Workers, KV

## Why learning 1 on 1 and pair programming
Building together can greatly accelerate learning. A small amount of time a few days a week practicing a skill. Live feedback, ambient learning, and exploration supported mentors are keys to immersive education. The purpose of this system is to spark creativity and continuous re-categorification of knowledge.
- We use our own private self hosted encrytped network. 
- During the class you make a key!

> ML variation (left) Our algorithm (right)

## Project Background
Samples of integrating popular open source libs to get students up to speed quickly on contributing to real systems.

## Numbers come in many forms
![Earthy Fractals](images/composite.png)
> A study of complex numbers, fractals and coloring algorithms. Written from scratch in javascript. The coloring algorithm was challenging and fun. Three hours of code into this program taught me more than three months of college algebra.
